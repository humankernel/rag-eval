# 🧠 WikiQA Dataset Creator

![screenshot](paper/ui.png)

**WikiQA** is a tool for generating **synthetic question–answer datasets** using **Wikipedia** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
It was developed to support the evaluation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, particularly [this RAG evaluator](https://github.com/humankernel/rag-revamped).

## 🧩 Question Types

Each dataset entry belongs to one of several **cognitive and reasoning categories**, enabling targeted evaluation of RAG models:

1. ✅ **Factual** – objective, verifiable facts.
2. 🔗 **Multi-Hop** – multi-step reasoning or combined facts.
3. 🧠 **Semantic** – interpretation and meaning of concepts.
4. ⚙️ **Logical Reasoning** – applying formal rules or laws.
5. 💡 **Creative Thinking** – open-ended or hypothetical reasoning.
6. 📏 **Problem-Solving** – applying formulas or methods to compute results.
7. ⚖️ **Ethical & Philosophical** – moral or conceptual reflection on science.

Each question type is designed to stress different aspects of retrieval and generation in RAG systems.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Although WikiQA only generates datasets, it is designed around **RAG evaluation metrics** (see [Key Metrics and Evaluation Methods for RAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRz0BWkuwHg)).

### 🔍 Retrieval Metrics

| Metric                           | Measures                    | Description                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision**                    | Relevance of retrieved docs | Fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant     |
| **Recall**                       | Coverage of relevant docs   | Fraction of relevant documents that were retrieved    |
| **Hit Rate**                     | Top-result success          | % of queries retrieving ≥1 relevant doc in top-k      |
| **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**   | Top result position         | Measures how high the first relevant doc ranks        |
| **NDCG**                         | Ranking quality             | Evaluates both relevance and order of retrieved docs  |
| **MAP (Mean Average Precision)** | Overall retrieval accuracy  | Averages precision over all relevant docs and queries |

### ✍️ Generation Metrics

| Metric                 | Measures                              | Example                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faithfulness**       | Factual consistency with context      | “Einstein was born in Germany on March 14, 1879.”    |
| **Answer Relevance**   | How well the answer fits the question | Adds missing but relevant info like France → “Paris” |
| **Answer Correctness** | Alignment with ground truth           | Matches true reference answer accurately             |

## ⚙️ Example Use Case

This tool can be used to:

* Build **synthetic QA datasets** for RAG benchmark testing.
* Evaluate the **retrieval** and **generation** quality of LLM-based systems.
* Train or fine-tune **retrieval models** on domain-specific scientific content.
